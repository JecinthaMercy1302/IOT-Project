# ðŸ§­ Real-Time Position and Orientation Monitoring System (Wokwi Simulation)

ðŸ‘‰Aim:

To design and implement a system that monitors the position and orientation of an object using real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data and displays the data on an OLED screen using the Wokwi Simulator.

ðŸ‘‰Problem Statement:

In many devices like robots, drones, and fitness trackers, it's important to know how an object moves or rotates. But making such a system with real hardware can be expensive and hard for beginners. 
This project offers a simple and low-cost way to understand and try out this idea using a simulator, sensors, and a small display. It's helpful for students or anyone who wants to learn how these systems work.
Scope of the Solution
â€¢	Real-time display of orientation data (roll, pitch, yaw).
â€¢	Simulated environment using Wokwi.
â€¢	Display output on OLED screen.
â€¢	GitHub and documentation for further development.


ðŸ‘‰Required Component:

Hardware:
â€¢	ESP32 Development Board
â€¢	MPU6050 Sensor Module
â€¢	OLED Display 
â€¢	Jumper wires

Software:
â€¢	Wokwi (for simulation)
