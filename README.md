# Position Monitoring System

Aim:

To design and implement a system that monitors the position and orientation of an object using real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data and displays the data on an OLED screen using the Wokwi Simulator.

Problem Statement:

In many devices like robots, drones, and fitness trackers, it's important to know how an object moves or rotates. But making such a system with real hardware can be expensive and hard for beginners. 
This project offers a simple and low-cost way to understand and try out this idea using a simulator, sensors, and a small display. It's helpful for students or anyone who wants to learn how these systems work.
Scope of the Solution
•	Real-time display of orientation data (roll, pitch, yaw).
•	Simulated environment using Wokwi.
•	Display output on OLED screen.
•	GitHub and documentation for further development.


Required Component:

Hardware:
•	ESP32 Development Board
•	MPU6050 Sensor Module
•	OLED Display 
•	Jumper wires

Software:
•	Wokwi (for simulation)
